## Er, no inappropriate content!

SilkWiki is very safe for children. But I don't tolerate any adult content.

## No testing

Don't use SilkWiki for testing Markdown. For that, go to [[SilkWiki@Sandbox]].

## Draft new articles

Add new articles into @WIP. This is to stand a article as work in progress. When you finish, you can move it out of @WIP.

## No nonsenses

No nonsense can jump on to this wiki. It would cause wiki dangers against SilkWiki and me. ([[Fun@Memes]] is exempt.)
